Layered sedimentary rocks preserve a vast majority of Earth's history. This course will cover how these layers of sediments form, the techniques geologists use to study them, and of course the history preserved within them. We will learn about how rocks are eroded =, transported, and deposited---how basins form in order to hold them and how the textures, compositions, and structures within the rocks bely the environments in which they form.

Our exploration of Earth's history will be a quantitative journey---meaning there will be math and coding involved. If you do not have much experience with applying math and coding to sceintific problems, it will be hard. But that is a good thing, we are here to do hard things. hi
